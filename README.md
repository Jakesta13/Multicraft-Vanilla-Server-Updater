# Multicraft-Vanilla-Server-Updater
This is made to be ran via Multicraft's Script functions and currently updates to the latest SNAPSHOT of minecraft when ran.

## Requirements
* [mcrcon](https://github.com/Tiiffi/mcrcon) - I will remove this requirement once I've changed over to purely using MutlicraftAPI
* MulticraftApi.php - Get this from your panel files.
* Multicraft panel
* PHP - but this is usually already installed if you have multicraft.

## Script file setup
T O - B E - U P D A T E D

## Argumments
~~Arguments? This is at Wendys sir~~
* `update.sh force` - Will tell the script to update during the month of April. Use caution when on April 1st, you might get bamboozled.

## To-Do
* Switch entirely over to MulticraftApi.php
* Make all settings into the main script file for the php scripts.
* Check if there is actually an update before alrerting everyone that the server is going down for an update    
    Rather than announcing an update every time you run it (E.g if you use it as a way to reboot normally but update check too)
* Figure out how GitHub Actions work to make ZIP releases.
